# üß≠ True North Data Strategies ‚Äì Repository Hub

**Enterprise-grade automation for businesses that have been around longer than smartphones.**

This is our curated catalog of internal tools, client platforms, AI integrations, and operational systems. Think of it as the front door to how we build things that actually work‚Äînot just look impressive in demos.

## üéØ What We Build

For SMBs who want visibility, control, and tools that just work:

- Custom automation workflows that save actual time
- Clear dashboards that tell you what's happening in your business
- Simple integrations with the apps you already use
- AI that solves real problems (not just adds chatbots to everything)
