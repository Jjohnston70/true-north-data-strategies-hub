# 🤘 Pipeline Punk Dropouts

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Pipeline Punk Dropouts** is a brutally honest, zero-fluff coding education platform for the automation-curious and bullshit-averse.  
We teach browser-based programming (JavaScript, HTML, etc.) the way it should be taught — with sarcasm, dark humor, and a deep hatred of repetitive tasks.

If you're still manually copy-pasting data in 2025, congrats: you're a very expensive, slow robot.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Tone & Voice**
   - Profanity is welcome, but purposeful.
   - Sarcasm is a teaching tool, not a personality trait.
   - We roast bad habits, not people.
   - Automate the crap out of everything.
   - Admit what sucks. Fix what matters.
